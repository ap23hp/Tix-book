# Decisions

## 001 — ORM: Prisma
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, plain SQL
**Decision:** Prisma
**Why:**

- small schema file, built-in migrations
- Type-safe client: TypeScript catches mistakes in queries
**Trade-off:** Prisma hides SQL and uses its own small schema language. Some queries (like row locking with SELECT ... FOR UPDATE in phase 4) will need raw SQL.
**Revisit if:** I end up writing raw SQL for most queries, or hit performance or connection problems I can't solve.

## 002 — Styling: Tailwind CSS, own components
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, a component library (MUI, shadcn/ui)
**Decision:** Tailwind CSS, with my own components (no component library)
**Why:**
- Works well with Next.js
- Building my own Button, Modal and seat picker shows frontend skill, including accessibility
**Trade-off:** Long class lists in JSX
**Revisit if:** Class lists become hard to read; then extract more components.

## 003 — Test runner: Jest
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Jest, Vitest
**Decision:** Jest
**Why:**
- I've used Jest before
- Test syntax is almost the same in both, so the skills transfer
**Trade-off:** Jest needs extra setup to work with TypeScript.
**Revisit if:** The Jest + TypeScript setup becomes painful; Vitest is a quick switch.
