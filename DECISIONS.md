# Decisions

## 001 — ORM: Prisma
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, plain SQL
**Decision:** Prisma
**Why:**

- small schema file, built-in migrations
- Type-safe client: TypeScript catches mistakes in queries
**Trade-off:** Prisma hides SQL and uses its own small schema language. Some queries (like row locking with SELECT ... FOR UPDATE in phase 4) will need raw SQL.
**Revisit if:** I end up writing raw SQL for most queries, or hit performance or connection problems I can't solve.

## 002 — Styling: Tailwind CSS, own components
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, a component library (MUI, shadcn/ui)
**Decision:** Tailwind CSS, with my own components (no component library)
**Why:**
- Works well with Next.js
- Building my own Button, Modal and seat picker shows frontend skill, including accessibility
**Trade-off:** Long class lists in JSX
**Revisit if:** Class lists become hard to read; then extract more components.

## 003 — Test runner: Jest
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Jest, Vitest
**Decision:** Jest
**Why:**
- I've used Jest before
- Test syntax is almost the same in both, so the skills transfer
**Trade-off:** Jest needs extra setup to work with TypeScript.
**Revisit if:** The Jest + TypeScript setup becomes painful; Vitest is a quick switch.
## 004 — Tickets: one booking = one ticket (no separate tickets table)
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Separate Ticket table (one row per seat) vs using the Booking itself as the ticket
**Decision:** A confirmed booking is the ticket. One booking reference and one QR code per booking, whatever the number of seats.
**Why:**
- Everything the ticket screen shows (event, seats, paid, status, reference) is already on the booking
- Two tables with the same data would need updating in two places, and could go out of sync
- Matches the wireframes: one QR for a 2-seat booking
**Trade-off:** People in the same booking can't be checked in separately at the door.
**Revisit if:** I add per-seat tickets or door check-in (listed under Later).

## 005 — Seats left: calculated, not stored
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** A `seatsLeft` counter column vs calculating from bookings
**Decision:** Store only `seatLimit`. Seats left = seatLimit − seats in HELD and CONFIRMED bookings.
**Why:** A counter can go out of sync (e.g. the booking saves but the counter update fails), which could oversell seats. Calculating always matches the real bookings. Correct first, fast later.
**Trade-off:** An extra count query each time seats left is needed.
**Revisit if:** It becomes slow; fix with indexes or caching.

## 006 — Money stored as integer pence
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Options considered:** Decimal pounds (12.50) vs integer pence (1250)
**Decision:** Integer pence, in a field named `pricePence`. 0 = free.
**Why:**
- Decimals in JavaScript aren't exact (0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004)
- Integers avoid rounding errors in totals and refunds
- Stripe also uses the smallest currency unit, so no conversion needed
**Trade-off:** Must divide by 100 whenever displaying a price.
**Revisit if:** Multiple currencies with different smallest units are needed.

## 007 — Conditional rules: nullable in the database, enforced by the app
Date: 2 Nov 2026

**Decision:** Fields that are only required in some cases are nullable in the database, and the API enforces the rule:
- `venueName`, `venueAddress`, `doorsAt`: required only for IN_PERSON events
- `meetingLink`: required only to publish an ONLINE event
- `coverImageUrl`: optional for drafts, required to publish
- Only users with role ORGANISER can create events
**Why:**
- A database column can't say "required only sometimes", and a foreign key can't check another table's column (like role)
- Drafts can be saved unfinished: save now, complete later
**Trade-off:** The rules live in code, so they need tests to make sure they're enforced.
**Revisit if:** The same rule is needed in many places; move it into one shared validation function.
